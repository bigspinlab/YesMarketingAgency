## Setup

- Download Node.js from your favorite browser [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installation

- Open the Project with your favorite IDE
- Run the Shell
- In the Shell run the following commands:
  - `npm i -g npm gulp gulp-cli` (if is your first project using npm and gulp)
  - `npm i`
  - `gulp build` to compile files to `dist` folder
- In case you need to install a third part dependency, remember to add it on config scripts.js and styles.js file the node module path to vendors config.
- In case you are not using third part packages, just remove the import vendors from the build.

## Features

- A live-reloading server with [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/)
- Automated build process that includes, but is not limited to: SCSS compilation (with Autoprefixer included) and image optimization
- Ability to add 3rd party plugins easily - `gulp/_config.js`
- Minified CSS & JS in dist folder
- SourceMaps for better debugging
- Core JS files includes (e.g.: URL external fix for security issue)
- Code Formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Compiling HTML files from Pug
- Writing Pug with JSON, to separate logic from content
- Favicons Included
- Styleguide with links for templates/modules

## Tasks

- `gulp` - Create the local server (BrowserSync) and watch for source files
- `gulp build` - Compiles source files into `dist` folder, also cleans unused files in `dist`

## Notes

- Doesn't support Internet Explorer
- [gulp-cli](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp-cli) must be v2.30+
- The original idea of this boilerplate comes from Fabio Serpa, see his repo [here](https://github.com/dippas/Frontend-StarterKit). All I have done is clean the project to meet my needs.
